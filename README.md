Build your own Open GApps
---------------
If you want to build your own version of Open GApps, you'll need to get the git sources:

To initialize your local repository using the Open GApps source tree, use a command like:
```
git clone git@github.com:opengapps/opengapps.git
```
Then sync the submodules to get the original APK sources as provided by Google.
You can also use this command to update at a later moment the sources to the most recent version
```
./download_sources.sh
```

To build Open GApps for all platforms and all android releases:
```
make
```
To build Open GApps for a specific android release on a specific platform,
define both the platform and the API level of that release, seperated by a dash and optionally add the variant with another dash.
Two (most widely used) examples:
```
make arm-22
```
or
```
make arm-22-stock
```
One can update the sources used with the command:
```
./add_sourceapp.sh /path/to/the/file/you/want/to/add.apk [/even/more/files.apk...]
```
For contributors, updated sources can be uploaded by using this command:
```
./upload.sh
```
